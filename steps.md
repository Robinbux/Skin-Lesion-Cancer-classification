# Notes
Task: Computer vision on a dataset of cancer data with 2 classes Benign and Malignant.
The images are skin lesion images.

## Preprocessing possibilities
- Data augmentation
- Image improvement using ESRGAN
- Image resizing (Maybe to 224*224*3)
- Image normalization
- Color constancy
- Image denoising (Adaptive median filter and Gaussian filter)
- Hair removal

## Model possibilities
- Transfer learning
- ResNet50
-
